# unblock_me_solver_on_android
A foreground service that will help the user to solve puzzles for the popular game called “Unblock Me”. 
The app will guide the user step by step to the fastest solution.
If the phone is rooted the user can let the program automatically move the blocks.
The app is written in Kotlin and partially in Python. 
A Yolov8s object detector model from Ultalytics is used for detecting blocks. 
Currently only works with the default theme.
